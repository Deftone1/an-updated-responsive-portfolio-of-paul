## INITIAL README

For this project I was to utilize Bootstrap (integrated with HTML) as much as possible in creating a personal application for myself.

I started with a simple design for a 'Home' page with a nice image and a navigation bar.

My 'About' page included a few different photos and descriptions of some of my favorite activities.  It was also the first time the grid layout was used from Bootstrap.

The 'Portfolio' page showcased some of my musical accomplishments with links to the videos, opened in new tabs. I used two different rows (one with three columns, one with two columns).

My contact page included three links to my LinkedIn, E-mail, and Facebook accounts.

I intentionally slightly darkened the background colors of the pages as you progressed from Home-Contact to add a little extra thoughtful design. This was a very satisfying and interesting project to complete, I am very happy with the end result. 

## UPDATE 10/25/2020:

All of the pages were cleaned up not only with format but also in appearance. 

Some of the previous Bootstrap I was using was removed and CSS add instead. 

I noticed previously that my CSS page was not linked, so that was corrected.

 Cards were added to house some of the links on my portfolio page and about page as well.

My Github biography was modified, and I reached out to follow multiple students within the Bootcamp.

A dropdown was created on my portfolio showcasing a few GitHub projects.
