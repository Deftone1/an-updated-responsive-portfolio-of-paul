For this project I was to utilize Bootstrap (integrated with HTML) as much as possible in creating a personal application for myself.

I started with a simple design for a 'Home' page with a nice image and a navigation bar.

My 'About' page included a few different photos and descriptions of some of my favorite activities.  It was also the first time the grid layout was used from Bootstrap.

The 'Portfolio' page showcased some of my musical accomplishments with links to the videos, opened in new tabs. I used two different rows (one with three columns, one with two columns).

My contact page included three links to my LinkedIn, E-mail, and Facebook accounts.

I intentionally slightly darkened the background colors of the pages as you progressed from Home-Contact to add a little extra thoughtful design. This was a very satisfying and interesting project to complete, I am very happy with the end result. 

The updated version:

I first added more sections to my portfolio page, starting with the Portfolio page. I added a button for GitHub and a button for a PDF version of my resume, which I included into the portfolio. 

Below these buttons were three additional buttons that linked up to my GitHub projects.
